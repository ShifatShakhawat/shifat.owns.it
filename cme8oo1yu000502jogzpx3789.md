For years, GitHub was more than just a code hosting platform — it was the home for developers. A place where collaboration, open-source contributions, and community-driven innovation thrived. Many of us saw it as a safe corner of the internet, run by and for developers.

But the winds of change began in 2018 when Microsoft acquired GitHub for $7.5 billion. At the time, Microsoft promised independence for the platform, assuring the developer community that GitHub would remain true to its roots. For a while, it seemed like they kept that promise.

**The Turning Point**

Fast forward to 2025, and the recent resignation of GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke signals a major shift. GitHub will no longer operate as a separate entity — it’s being fully absorbed into Microsoft’s AI engineering core.

This is more than just a leadership change. It’s the removal of a buffer that once kept GitHub somewhat autonomous from its parent company. Now, GitHub’s direction will be tightly aligned with Microsoft’s broader AI agenda.

**From “What Developers Want” to “What AI Needs”**

The implications are clear:

Code as Training Data – Every commit, pull request, and repository can now feed Microsoft’s AI models.

Strategic Priorities Shift – Decisions may focus less on community-driven features and more on enhancing Microsoft’s AI capabilities.

Potential Benefits & Risks – While AI-powered tools like GitHub Copilot could improve, the community might lose influence over the platform’s evolution.

**The Bigger Picture**

Some will argue this is simply progress — that AI integration will make GitHub smarter, faster, and more efficient. Others see it as the end of an era, where open-source culture takes a back seat to corporate AI strategy.

In truth, it’s both. GitHub will likely remain a central hub for code, but its soul — the grassroots, developer-first ethos — may fade. This is not the GitHub we grew up with; it’s a new kind of platform, one designed around the needs of a trillion-dollar tech giant.

**What’s Next for Developers?**

If you’re a developer, this shift means being more intentional about where and how you host your code. It could be a push toward decentralization — platforms like GitLab, SourceHut, or self-hosted Git solutions might see renewed interest.

Microsoft’s GitHub will continue to be powerful, but the question is: powerful for whom?

The old GitHub may be gone, but the spirit of open-source can’t be bought — it just finds new homes.
